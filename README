LibreDWG 0.4-pre1

LibreDWG is a free C library to read and write DWG files.

It is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (or at you
 opinion any later version).

We have forked LibDWG due to its usage of Esperanto, which we think is not the best
 strategy for a free software project which aims to get lots of contributors. LibreDWG is 
written in English. Since we forked LibDWG (May 16, 2009), its development seems to
 have been inactive. At the moment (September 25, 2009) our decoder is almost done. 
We are reaching 100% read support in our data structures parser but we still need a
 test suite. Among the example applications we wrote using LibreDWG is an initial SVG
 conversion tool. We intend to become a GNU package soon. Please contact us if you
 can help.

Sometimes we hang on our IRC channel which is #libredwg at irc.freenode.net

== Example usage of the library ==

The examples directory contains some application code that uses our lib:

* load_dwg.c -- This is a skeleton code. Look there if you want to have a quickly glance on
 how to use the library.

* dwg_ps.c -- Opens a DWG file and outputs an PostScript file. This code depends on 
the PSlib library. On Debian-based systems this is usually available as a package
 named pslib-dev

* testSVG.c -- Opens a DWG file and outputs an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file. SVG is
 a W3C standard for 2d vector graphics. You can open these files on several free software tools.
 We recomend Inkscape, a free software vector graphics editor. The testSVG.c program will not
 handle 3d content from DWG since SVG only supports 2-dimensional images.

* get_bmp.c -- Extracts the bmp thumbnail of a dwg file when it is available.
