* R2007: fix some string stream and handle stream offsets, wrong have_string
  bit offset.
* R2010+: fix object bitsize.
* pre-R13: finish entities, block entities
* PROXY subentities, PROXY_ENTITY
* CELLSTYLEMAP TABLE_Cell struct
* DIMSTYLE_CONTROL: one R2000+ RC missing
* LEADER: associated_annotation, dimstyle handles (untested)
* undocumented and apparently unused: LONG_TRANSACTION, DUMMY
* SPATIAL_INDEX class/object untested
* WIPEOUTVARIABLE class/object untested
* link VBA_PROJECT object to its section, and vice versa
* ACIS: implement parsing of SAT file version 2
  in ACIS entities 37, 38 and 39
* convert XRECORD xdata linked-list ResBuf to array of eed[],
  same structure as common EED.

* merge decode_r2007 with the 2004 decoder. It is almost the same, just
  the sections have multiple pages. Only for this version. 2010+ uses
  the 2004 format.
* encode for 2004+: move the local structs to the dwg, as union?
* finish DXF writing (easy)
* add DXF reading (easy)
* add binary DXF
* move verbosity/loglevel to some dwg or dat struct
* add programs manpages, add getopt_long, --verbose --version --license
* add make target: manual

* fix the remaining leaks.
* enhance and document the API functions.
* add the basic DWG layout and API to the docs.
* add more defaults when encoding from older to newer versions.
* automate windows nightlies and binary releases via appveyor.
  POSIX releases via travis => github (savannah/ftpupload)?
* check testsuite errors when cross-compiled under wine.
  latest wine needs a new WINEARCH env var.
