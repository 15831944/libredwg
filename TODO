* R2010+: fix some remaining fields. Most DWG's can be read.
* pre-R13: finish
* PROXY subentities, PROXY_ENTITY
* CELLSTYLEMAP TABLE_Cell struct
* DIMSTYLE_CONTROL: one R2000+ RC missing
* SPATIAL_INDEX class/object untested
* WIPEOUTVARIABLE class/object untested
* link VBA_PROJECT object to its section, and vice versa
* ACIS: implement parsing of SAT file version 2,
  in ACIS entities 37, 38 and 39
* convert XRECORD xdata linked-list ResBuf to array of eed[],
  same structure as common EED.

* merge decode_r2007 with the 2004 decoder. It is almost the same, just
  the sections have multiple pages. Only for this version. 2010+ uses
  the 2004 format.
* encode for 2004+: move the local structs to the dwg, as union?
* finish DXF writing, test with AutoCAD open.
* finish binary DXF (easy). cross-check via: filedia 0, dxfout => Binary
* add DXF reading (medium)
* finish GeoJSON http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html
* add getopt_long() for position independent options
* check osm tools https://gitlab.com/osm-c-tools/osmctools how
  they could import GIS data easier.
  Check OpenStreetMap XML and PBF formats.
* add one of the easy OGR formats: gml, gpx.
  See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Dxf2gpx
  https://grass.osgeo.org/grass74/manuals/v.in.dxf.html and dwg (teigha and opencad)
* add geomutils to tesselate curves (e.g. GeomJSON),
  and to transform OCS/UCS objects when being displayed (e.g. svg, ps).
  add API funcs to find table elements (layer, ltype).
* check DWG constraints vs FreeCAD constraints
  https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Sketcher_Workbench#Sketcher_Constraints
* check valabind vapi files to generate more and better bindings
  (e.g. radare2-bindings). rust, go, node, java, perl, ruby, php, autolisp (via ARX).

* fix the remaining leaks (xdata?).
* enhance and document the API functions.
* add the basic DWG layout and API to the docs.
* publish manual and link to doxygen refman API
* add more defaults when encoding from older to newer versions.
* build releases via travis => github (savannah/ftpupload)?
* add fuzzing and solver-based test generation (bits)
* check testsuite errors when cross-compiled under wine.
  latest wine needs a new WINEARCH env var.
* check for a waiver/copyright assignment from
  Alex Papazoglou <papazoga> for his reed-solomon code (yet unused).
  Otherwise use rscode-1.3 by Henry Minsky <hqm@alum.mit.edu> which is GPLv3.
