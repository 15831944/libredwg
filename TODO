* BITCODE_TIMELL type for TDCREATE, ...
* pre-R13: tables, entities, block entities
* PROXY subentities, PROXY_ENTITY
* CELLSTYLEMAP TABLE_Cell struct
* DIMSTYLE_CONTROL: one R2000+ RC missing
* LEADER: associated_annotation, dimstyle handles (untested)
* undocumented and apparently unused: LONG_TRANSACTION, DUMMY
* FIELD: value p20.4.99

* enhance and document the API functions.
* add the basic DWG layout and API to the docs.
* add more defaults when encoding from older to newer versions.
* automate windows nightlies and binary releases via appveyor,
  POSIX releases via travis => github (savannah?).
* check testsuite errors when cross-compiled under wine.
  latest wine needs a new WINEARCH env var.
