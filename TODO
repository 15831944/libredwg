This is a rough TODO file.

* fix segfaults when reading some newer DWG files.

  in entities 37, 38 and 39
* SPATIAL_INDEX
* PROXY subentities, PROXY_ENTITY
* CELLSTYLEMAP TABLE_Cell struct
* HATCH: some parts are missing
* DIMSTYLE_CONTROL: one R2000+ RC missing
* LEADER: associated_annotation, dimstyle handles
* undocumented and apparently unused: LONG_TRANSACTION, DUMMY
* SPLINE: ctrl_pts
* FIELD: value p20.4.99
* TABLE: unknown kBuffer, kResBuf, kGeneral types
* VISUALSTYLE: hard-pointer to H DICTIONARY_VISUALSTYLE
* WIPEOUT and WIPEOUTVARIABLE objects
* link VBA_PROJECT object to its section, and vice versa
* XRECORD: BITCODE_H* objid_handles

* fix the remaining compiler warnings.
* add all DWG versions for one simple common decode test.
* check 32bit/64bit strictness with the public headers (internally we can handle it)
* enhance and document the API functions
* add more defaults when encoding from older to newer versions.
* make python bindings optional, no hard error by default.
* automate windows nightlies and binary releases via appveyor,
  POSIX releases via travis => github (savannah?)
* support testsuite when cross-compiled under wine
