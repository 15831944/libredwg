# Commentary:

# This is a provisional test (until something better comes along).
# It checks "aliveness" and not correctness or performance.
#
# It relies on the TESTS_ENVIRONMENT Makefile.am variable to set
# `PROGS'.  Each prog in PROGS is run against each of sample.dwg
# and example.dwg, and if *not* successful the maximally verbose
# output (from setting LIBREDWG_TRACE=9) is saved in a file whose
# name is {sample,example}.PROG.log.
#
# If there are no problems, exit successfully.  Otherwise display
# the count of problem runs, the list of *.log files and finally
# exit failurefully.

# Code:

test "$PROGS" || { echo ERROR: Env var PROGS not set ; exit 1 ; }
test "$srcdir" || { echo ERROR: Env var srcdir not set ; exit 1 ; }
